# Meet Me at the Spot

For my stackathon, I curated Meet me at the Spot, which is an online database that uses different APIâ€™s from museums across the world. 

Whenever I travel, I enjoy exploring the local museums and seeing what history lies inside. Every museum hosts exhibitions that are temporary, and it can be hard to narrow it down to visit just one museum. Meet me at the spot allows me to look at a range of museums, and see the exhibitions on display. 

Each museum has a different API with different data. I was able to fetch public data that had exhibitions and showcase it here.
